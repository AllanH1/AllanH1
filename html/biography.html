            <h3 class="biography__subtitle">Part One</h3>
            <p class="biography__body">I was a good kid. I did everything my mother told me to. I got good grades, did my homework, and came home on
                time. I was also spoiled. Very spoiled. if I wanted something, I cried until I got it. And boy did I get
                things. Lastly, I was sheltered. I didn't have many friends and didn't do many exciting things. These 3 aspects
                combined resulted in me being a timid young child. This continued throughout middle school. Then high school
                happened.
                <br>
                <br> In high school I thought I was smarter than everyone else. Better than everyone else. I stopped doing homework
                because I thought I knew everything already. People didn't like me, they thought I was a nerdy jerk who thought
                he was better than them. And they were right, I was a jerk. I was upset at them for making fun of me and
                disliking me and not wanting to be friends with me but I never stopped to think it was my own fault. And
                then I got a job.
            </p>
            <h3 class="biography__subtitle">Part Two</h3>
            <p class="biography__body">My grades in highschool had drastically fallen compared to the once great middle and elementary school days.
                I was 17 and since I was no longer a child my parents had stopped buying me things. Time for a job. My first
                ever job was at a local breakfast place in Charlotte, NC named The Original Pancake House. Working in an
                environment were everyone was older and wiser than me really helped me realize that I am not nor will ever
                be the biggest fish in the pond, and trying to act like I am was a waste of time.
                <br>
                <br> I have become more understanding, friendly, helpful, easy to work with and be around. I can attribute all
                of it not only to this local buisness, but also the patrons and individuals who walk in and out of it on
                a daily basis. I met and spoke to many wise people, both young and old, about many of their experiences.
                Some were well established professionals that were good at their job. Others were on the verge of becoming
                CEOs. But my biggest takeaway was that these were all still regular people that struggle just like me and
                you. With a fresh and positive outlook on life, the couple of years that followed were abundant with joy.
                <br>
                <br>And then reality set in.

            <h3 class="biography__subtitle">Part Three</h3>
            <p class="biography__body">
                At this point I was 20 and had been making good money at the restaurant. But I wasn't thinking of the future. I bought myself
                a new computer, new clothes, even a brand new car. I was a hard worker and wanted to reward myself, but I
                was only thinking in the now. I came to this realization after what was probably the busiest and most stressful
                night I've ever worked there. "Did I want to be doing this forever? Where was this going to lead?" I had
                finished high school but didn't have any money saved for college and my family couldn't afford it either.
                I felt as if my future was slowly collapsing in front of me.
                <br>
                <br>Then, a light. A bright shining beacon of hope: Road to Hire. I learned about Road to Hire through my brother
                who recently graduated from the program and was now working for Red Ventures. It's a program that takes dedicated
                young adults and gives them the tools they need to build a professional career. And all you needed was a
                high school degree and a good work ethic. This was it. This was my chance to get back on my feet and start
                moving forward again.
                <br>
                <br> And that is where I currently am. Progressing through the Road to Hire program little by little together
                with a group of amazing people all around me. I'm motivated and excited for the future and I can't wait to
                keep adding on to this page...
